# The Blog Website

Practicing using Embedded JavaScript Templating (EJS), Node.JS, Express, and a little Bootstrap by making a Blog Website

## Description:

The purpose of this project, provided by The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu, is to take everything learned so far and put it into practice. A big new feature not previously discussed is the ability to create new webpages off of posts composed by the user.

## Topics I Learned within This Project:

1. I learned about the "forEach" Method which loops through each element in an Array

2. How to utilize Express's Route Parameters to create a dynamic URL and Website

3. I learned what a "Kebab Case" was

4. Utilizing LoDash, a Utility Library, within Node.JS

5. How to Truncate a String

6. How to make an Anchor Tag href using EJS Tags

## How I Did and my Final Thoughts (Further Updates Below the Images...):

Wow, a lot of this material clicked from the To-Do List I created but one thing that took some time to digest was within the App.JS File where I utilized Express's Route Parameters. It wasn‚Äôt the Route Parameters that had me stumped but rather everything that was encompassed within it. Nonetheless, I took the time to digest it and understand how everything worked within it.

This was a cool project to see a lot come together and while I find it challenging, it has been the most rewarding in turns of programming.

# Updates:

I did not like the appearance of the website, so I spent time redoing the appearance and uploaded the project to Heroku where it is now live!

## Things Changed:

I incorporated BootStrap for the Navigation Bar, uploaded a nice image for the background, and set the z-index to -1 so the background image appears behind all the content. I updated the text of the About and Contact pages to accurately reflect what information I want to provide. I made the page responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
